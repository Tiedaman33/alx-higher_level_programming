""""Solves the N-queens puzzle.

Determines all possible solutions to placing N
N non-attacking queens on an NxN chessboard.

Example:
    $ ./101-nqueens.py N

N must be an integer greater than or eqaul to 4.

Attributes:
    board (list): A list of lists representing the chessboard
    solutions (list): A list of lists containing solutions.

solutions are represented in the format [[r, c], [r, c], [r, c], [r, c]]
where 'r' and 'c' represents the row and column, 
repectively, where a 
queen must be  placed on the chessborad.
